# `Regeneration-Block`
`A very simple ROBLOX creation used for regenerating a block`

## Overview
The **`RegenButton.rbxm`** model offers a streamlined solution for regenerating any part or instance within the ROBLOX metaverse. By integrating this model into your project, you can effortlessly regenerate specific elements without the risk of spamming or error. This feature is invaluable for both players and developers looking to refresh or regenerate in-game items seamlessly.

## Set Up
- Download the **`RegenButton.rbxm`** model file
- Open ROBLOX Studio
- Insert the file by going to File > Insert from file > path.to.RegenButton.rbxm

Alternatively, you can also download the **`RegenButton.rbxl`** file and open the studio place instance directly.

Simply place any instance item into the **'Templates'** folder and they can be regenerated with the button. Additionally, the **`Regen.lua`** script includes a *'Settings'* section, which allows developers to slightly customize its behavior as needed.
